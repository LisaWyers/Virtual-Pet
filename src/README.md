# Virtual Pet application 

In this folder you will find the coding for the application I have created fior my first virtual pet. 

The pet I have created is interactive and it can be fed and walked. If the pet gets too hungry or unfit it will die. The pet can only live to be 30 days old. 

# Installation

I have created the pet using javascript and it has been tested using Node and NPM.
